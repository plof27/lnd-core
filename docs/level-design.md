# Level Design [stub]

## Worlds
Instead of a traditional level structure, there is a series of about a dozen different **worlds**. Each world has some number of major objectives or challenges in it, similar to how each world in SM64 had 6 stars in it.

## Metadata

### Constraints
- [expected] Uses a relatively small set of reused level mechanics
- [desired] New level mechanics are built up over time, being introduced slowly 
- [desired] Each world is mechanically themed around one or two level mechanics

### Tolerances
- Stub

### Uncertainties
- How big are worlds?
- How many major objectives are in each world?
- Do you need to collect each major objective in order (before being able to collect the next), such as in Mario sunshine and galaxy? Or, can you collect the major objectives in any order? Something in the middle?
