## Metadata

### Constraints
- [required] Must be visually apparent to the player (including R/G colorblind players)
- [required] Game elements must read clearly in both the light and in the dark

### Tolerances
- [expected] Should assume very little about the core movement abilities

### Uncertainties
- How can the player control light and dark? What abilities do they have that directly interact with this mechanic?
- How does the light and dark affect enemies?
- How does the light and dark affect level design?
- How does the light and dark affect the player's core movement set?
