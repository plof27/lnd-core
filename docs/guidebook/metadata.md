## Constraints
*Dig your holes before you fill them.*
- Low artistic skills on team [required]
- Low musical and sound design skills on team [required]
- Should feel familiar to fans of 3D platformers, the 3D Mario series in particular [required]
- Light story elements [desired]
- There is a meaningful difference between any% and 100% [expected]

## Tolerances
*If you can't make it perfect, at least make it adjustable.*
- Both controller and kb+m should feel natural and supported
- Players must be able to rebind controls freely

## Uncertainties
*TODO: Figure this stuff out*
- What's the overall thematic hook for the game?
- What level mechanics are there? (ex: mines, things that run at you, crumbling platforms, tightropes, etc.)
- What gates progression between levels? (ex: collecting stars in levels, time, must beat previous to continue, etc.)
- Are there bosses? If so, what are they like? (Bowser, autoscroller thing, etc.)
